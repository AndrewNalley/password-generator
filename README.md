# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
This project was a learning tool used to introduce me to JavaScript logic. The simple task of generating a random password requires a good amount of logic in the code to work, especially when users should be able to choose the character types used and the length of the password. 

This generator will guide the user through a few easy steps so that they can get a randomly generated password. This is for users who can't think of a good, secure password. 

During this project, I learned a lot about using "if" statements in particular.
